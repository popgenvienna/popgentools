This folder contains an R script that calculates Woolf and Breslow-Day homogeneity tests p-values for population data stored in synchronized pileup file. 

Requirements	
------------
These programs should be installed:
-R, R packages: "Formula", "metafor"
 
The packages can be found on these locations: 
Formula package: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Formula/index.html
metafor package: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/index.html

You can install the packages by using the following two commands in a terminal window:

R CMD INSTALL "path_to_Formula_package.tar.gz"
R CMD INSTALL "path_to_metafor_package.tar.gz" 

Install the packages in the order as above, Formula package first, metafor second.

Input data
----------
Input file is a tab delimited file that contains a lightweight representation of all pileup files of interest. We call this file format synchronized pileup file format. You can obtain synchronized pileup from pileups of your interest using script popoolation2/synchronize-pileup.pl. For details about the synchronize pileup format see man page of script popoolation2/synchronize-pileup.pl.

We assume that the synchronize pileup contains the same number of populations that underwent two different treatments. 

As an input file you also can use a file that is output of CMH test whereas the file contains synchronized pileup columns as well.

Output data
-----------
Output file is a tab delimited text file that contains all the information as the input plus two extra columns at the end of the file. These two columns contain Woolf and Breslow-Day homogenity test p-value, respectively.  

Parameters
----------

Script homogenity.r expects three mandatory input parameters: --input, --output, and --populations. 

The first two parameters are names of input and output file. 

--populations 

the parameter specifies pairs of populations for which the odds ratio will be calculated. 
Each pair of populations has to be separated by a "," and the two populations for which 
the odds ratio will be calculated by a "-". For example when user provides 4-6,5-7 the script 
will calculate odds ratio for populations in fourth and sixth column and odds ratio 
for populations in fifth and seventh column. The columns are numbered from 1. This usually means, 
that the first column with populational data is a column numbered by 4.   

Example of a usage:

R --vanilla --slave --input "input_sync_pileup" --populations "populations" --output "output_file_name" < homogenity.r > "log" 2> "err"

R --vanilla --slave --input test_data/test_data_big --populations 4-7,5-8,6-9 --output test_data/test_data_big.out < homogenity.r > test_data/log 2> test_data/err

Try to use the script on files in test_data folder.
