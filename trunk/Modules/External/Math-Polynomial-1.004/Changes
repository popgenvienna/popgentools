                    Math::Polynomial Version 1.001
                    ------------------------------

- Release date: 2009-05-19

- Repackaged after Math-Polynomial-1.000.tar.gz had file transmission
  problems on its way to CPAN.

                    Math::Polynomial Version 1.000
                    ------------------------------

- Release date: 2009-05-19

- Author: Martin Becker

- Rewritten from scratch, using
  h2xs 1.23 with options -X -A -b 5.6.0 Math::Polynomial

- Usable coefficient spaces are now any object classes with
  well-defined basic arithmetic operations and equality checks.

- Objects are now essentially immutable.  The only property that
  may be changed dynamically configures formatting defaults.
  Thus, cloning is hardly ever necessary.

- Removed tidy() and size() methods and dropped tidiness concept, as it
  bore no mathematical significance.

- Degrees of coefficients in new() are now in ascending order and
  therefore equivalent to array indexes.

- Added monomial constructor.

- Changed Lagrange interpolation to take arrays of x- and y-values.

- Extended constructors to borrow coefficient space and stringification
  attributes when used as object methods.

- Added usage of coeff() without parameter, yielding list of all coefficients.

- Added coefficients() method, yielding non-empty list of coefficients.

- Added coeff_zero() and coeff_one() methods, yielding zero and unit
  elements of coefficient space.

- Added proper_degree() method yielding undef for zero polynomials.

- Added is_zero() method yielding true for zero polynomials.

- Renamed quotrem() operator to divmod().

- Added overloaded operators: bool ! ** << >> == !=

- Added methods: is_nonzero(), is_equal(), is_unequal(), is_monic(),
  add_const(), sub_const(), mul_const(), div_const(), pow(), pow_mod(),
  inv_mod(), shift_up(), shift_down(), slice(), monize(), mmod(), gcd(),
  xgcd(), differentiate(), integrate(), definite_integral().

- Renamed eval() method to evaluate() and sub() method to sub_().

- Removed configure() class method, renamed to_string() method to
  as_string() and added optional configuration parameter.

- Added lots of configuration options for string representation.

- Added string_config() method to configure as_string default behaviour
  globally and per object.

- Added $max_degree class variable to configure parameter sanity tests.

- Changed internal object structure to improve extensibility.

- Reworked test suite and examples.

- Reworked pod documentation.

- Added experimental module Math::Polynomial::Generic.


                    Math::Polynomial Version 0.04
                    -----------------------------

- Release date: 2007-07-12

- New maintainer: Martin Becker.

- Bugfix [rt.cpan.org #4788] (reported 2003 by prospective maintainer):
  Method tidy() looped endlessly on zero polynomials.

- Bugfix: Crashed on adding a constant.

- Bugfix: Crashed on negating via overloaded unary minus.

- Bugfix: Division of polynomials of equal degree gave wrong results.

- Bugfix: Division crashed with non-"tidy" polynomials.

- Bugfix: Division failed to catch zero denominator.

- Bugfix: Verbose stringification produced lots of warnings under -W.

- Added more test cases.

- Renamed example directory, fixed imports and added table of contents
  there.

- Added some metadata to Makefile.PL.

- Added documentation of exportable subroutines, moved quotrem to
  subroutines section, clarified some definitions.

- Moved all imports to top of the module.

- Added more standard sections to POD, like VERSION, DIAGNOSTICS, LICENCE.

- Added development status notice to README.

                    Math::Polynomial Version 0.03
                    -----------------------------

- Release date: 2001-02-23.

- Added more text about interpolation in general and Math::Polynomial
  specifically to the distribution.

- Fixed a bug where the last constant was omitted if it was one. This
  bug was reported independently by Sergey V. Kolychev, John Hurst,
  and Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS).

- By a suggestion from Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS) I also changed
  the verbose format slightly to print 'x + -1' as 'x - 1' (and
  similarly for all negative coefficients). For the special case,
  where the first coefficient is negative, the minus sign is still
  printed as if it was part of the coefficient; e.g., '-3*x + 4' is
  still printed as '-3*x + 4'.

- By suggestion from John Gamble I moved Math::Interpolate to inside
  the Math::Polynomial package---the subroutine is very small and
  tightly coupled to the Math::Polynomial package.


                    Math::Polynomial Version 0.02
                    -----------------------------

- Release date: 1998-08-13.

- Fixed a bug that caused erroneous behaviour when 0 was used in the
  interpolation routine.

                    Math::Polynomial Version 0.01
                    -----------------------------

- Release date: 1997-09-11.
